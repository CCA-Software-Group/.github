General purpose / pedagogical repos:
- [py_template](https://github.com/CCA-Software-Group/py_template) is a template you can use to quickly create your own Python repository with a common package file layout and optional continuous integration of: tests, formatting/linting, type checking, and docs. See that [repo's docs](https://cca-software-group.github.io/py_template/) for a 'getting started' guide.

- [from-python-script-to-package](https://github.com/CCA-Software-Group/from-python-script-to-package) is a guide to packaging your Python code for a range of goals and to incremental levels of complexity.

- [short_tutorials](https://github.com/CCA-Software-Group/short_tutorials) is a collection of small tutorials on various software development topics.
