# CCA-Software-Group

Welcome to the GitHub organization for the CCA Software Group! Feel free to create or contribute to a [repository](https://github.com/orgs/CCA-Software-Group/repositories), [plan a project](https://github.com/orgs/CCA-Software-Group/projects), or [discuss ideas](https://github.com/orgs/CCA-Software-Group/discussions). You can also check out the group's slack channel (Simons Foundation -> cca-software-group), and the group meeting notes and slides (link in slack).

The [py_template repository](https://github.com/CCA-Software-Group/py_template) is a template you can use to quickly create your own Python repository that has a common package file layout as well as continuous integration of tests, formatting/linting, optional type checking, and docs. See that [repo's docs](https://cca-software-group.github.io/py_template/) for a 'getting started' guide.
